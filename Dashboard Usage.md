# Department Analysis
This dashboard is used to analyze the probability of an employee leaving a department if they reside in different categories.
This can be used to determine what causes an employee to leave and how to keep an employee on board.

# Employee Value
This dashboard is used to compare an employee to their colleagues in the same department-salary group.
This can be used to determine if it is worth it to take measures to keep an employee that is likely to churn (as predicted by the classification model)

# Employee Stats
This dashboard is used to see how the employee is currently treated at the company.
This can be used in conjunction with the Department Analysis dashboard to determine what measures need to be taken to keep an employee

# Dashboard Link
The link is currently unavailable, but will be placed here once the dashboard is transfered into Tableau
For the time being, please download the dashboard in this repository to view it
